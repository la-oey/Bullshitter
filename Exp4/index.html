        <b>RIGHTS.</b> You may call the UCSD Human Research Protection Program at 858-657-5100 to ask about your rights
        as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
        <b>BENEFITS</b>. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may
        learn more about basic questions pertaining to memory, perception, cognition, and learning. This knowledge may

        research, there is also the possibility of loss of confidentiality. Information from participants will be
        identified by a study number. The database which relates the study number to a specific subject will be
        maintained in the study coordinators office.<br><br>
        <b>COPY OF CONSENT.</b> You have received a copy of this consent document to keep and a copy of the Experimental

    <p class="mtitle">
        Instructions for the game. Please read carefully.
    </p>
    <div>
    	<p>Your goal is to <b>beat your opponent into the ground by winning by the highest point differential possible</b>. <br><br>
    	You will take turns: On each turn, one person will draw <b id="instructMarblesSampled"></b> marbles, and report which marbles were drawn. Then, the other person will respond by saying whether they think the marble-drawer was LYING, or telling the truth.<br><br>
        Here's how the points work:
        <p class="indent">Each <b style="color:red">red</b> marble is 1 point for the marble-drawer.</p>
        <p class="indent">Each <b style="color:blue">blue</b> marble is 1 point for the responder.</p>
        <p>Only the marble-drawer will see the marbles that were actually drawn. So, the marble-drawer doesn't neccessarily need to tell the truth ;).<br><br>
        But be careful! If the responder DETECTS a lie, they can call out the marble-drawer as lying. If the marble-drawer was in fact lying, the responder gets +5 points, and the marble-drawer gets -5 points.</p>
        <p class="indent">E.g. Marble-drawer was lying: marble-drawer: -5 pts; responder: +5 pts</p>
        <p>If the marble-drawer is called out as lying but they were really telling the truth, the marble-drawer gains the points for the red marbles (as usual), and the responder gains the points for the blue marbles, except with a -5 penalty.</p>
    	<p class="indent">E.g. Marble-drawer was telling the truth: marble-drawer: +6 pts; responder: 4 - 5 = -1 pt</p>
        <p>Throughout the experiment, you will randomly be asked questions about the task. If you get the question correct, you will be able to move on. If not, you will have to wait 3 seconds before being able to move on.</p>
    	
    	<p>This is what a round looks like:</p>
